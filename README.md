# RxjsWorkshop

Demo project for ihomer Academy RxJS workshop.

Run project with `npm start`

Add new pages by generating a new Angular component using:  
`npm run ng generate component workshop/part1/p00-my-page -m workshop/part1`

Then in the module, in this case `part1.module.ts`, add a route for your new component.  
Now you can see your component by typing in this new address.
